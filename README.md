# A-ransomware-
# Project Description: Educational Ransomware Creation

# Introduction:

This project involves creating an educational ransomware to understand the workings of such malicious software and the security measures needed to protect against it. It's crucial to note that the use of this ransomware is strictly for educational and ethical purposes, and should never be used for malicious intent. The using language is python.

# Project Objectives:

• Understand how ransomware operates and the encryption techniques used.
• Implement security measures to protect against ransomware attacks, such as regular data backups, using antivirus and firewalls, and educating users on cybersecurity best practices.

# Important to kwo:

To install the cryptography package the command is:

- on linux: pip install cryptography
- on windows: py -m pip install cryptography

# Conclusion:

This project aims to raise awareness of the threat of ransomware and promote good cybersecurity practices. It's essential to always act ethically and legally in the field of cybersecurity and never use this knowledge for malicious purposes.
